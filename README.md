SQL code that I conpiled through USDA Data for Completion of my SQL for Data Science Coursera through UC DAVIS. 

context from final project:You are a Data Scientist working at the USDA. Your department has been tracking the production of various agricultural commodities across different states. 

Your datasets include:

`milk_production`, `cheese_production`, `coffee_production`, `honey_production`, `yogurt_production`, and a `state_lookup` table. 

The data spans multiple years and states, with varying levels of production for each commodity.

Your manager has requested that you generate insights from this data to aid in future planning and decision-making. You'll need to use SQL queries to answer the questions that come up in meetings, reports, or strategic discussions.
